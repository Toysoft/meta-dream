How does it work? Simply with PLi's OE!

Use https://github.com/OpenPLi/openpli-oe-core (test1 branch) with Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS as your base, Open a terminal inside "openpli-oe-core" folder and enter:
```
rm -rf meta-dream
git clone -b test1 https://github.com/DMM-PLi/meta-dream.git
rm -f meta-openpli/recipes-openpli/enigma2-plugins/enigma2-plugin-extensions-openwebif.bbappend
```
For latest updates you need to open a terminal inside "meta-dream" folder and enter:
```
git pull origin test1
```
each time you do "make update" for the OE.

Experimental machines:
```
dm820
dm7080
```
