How does it work? Simply with PLi's OE!

Use https://github.com/OpenPLi/openpli-oe-core (test branch) with Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS as your base, Open a terminal inside "openpli-oe-core" folder and enter:
```
rm -rf meta-dream
git clone -b test1 https://github.com/DMM-PLi/meta-dream.git
```
For latest updates you need to open a terminal inside "meta-dream" folder and enter:
```
git pull origin master
```
each time you do "make update" for the OE.

Experimental machines:
```
dm800 - Use Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS
dm820 - PLi's OE isn't recent enough!
dm7080 - PLi's OE isn't recent enough!
```
